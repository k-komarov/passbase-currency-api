# Currency conversion API

**Currency conversion API** is a GraphQL API that provides a small service converting Euro to US Dollar and vice-versa.

Access to `convert` is protected with Access Key that can be generated by creating a new project:
```
mutation {
  createProject(project: {name: "Project"}){
    name
    accessKey
  }
}
```

To access `convert` query use project's `accessKey` as an `Authorization` header:
```
convert(from: EUR to: USD amount: 10) {
  timestamp
  rate
  result
}
```
